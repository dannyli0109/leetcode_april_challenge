# [30-Day LeetCoding Challenge](https://leetcode.com/explore/other/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/)

With many of us around the world being encouraged to stay indoors and work from home, **this is the perfect opportunity for you to focus on studying up for future code interviews.** In order to help you stay focussed, LeetCode is running the **30-Day LeetCoding Challenge** for the month of **April. Each day**, we'll challenge you to solve a frequently-asked **interview problem.**
